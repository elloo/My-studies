# Computational complexity

* Describes the efficiency of different algorithms
    * Big O describes the worst-case scenario
    * Big Omega($\Omega$) describes the best-case scenario
* It is enough to simply think of these ideas conceptually.

From fastest to slowest:
Computational complexity class | Class name
---|---
O(1)|Constant time
O(log n)|Logarithmic time
O(n)|Linear time
O(n log n)|Linearithmic time
O(n^2)|Quadratic time
O(n^c)|Polynomial time
O(c^n)|Exponential time
O(n!)|Factorial time
O()|Infinite time
