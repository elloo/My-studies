1. What’s stdint.h?
A header that defines different integer types to have different widths (number of bits used to store it's value).
It also includes corresponding sets of macros.

2. What’s the point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program?
These different integer types allocate a corresponding amount of memory in bits.

3. How many bytes is a BYTE, a DWORD, a LONG, and a WORD, respectively?
BYTE = 1 byte (8 bits)
DWORD = 4 bytes (32 bits)
LONG = 4 bytes (32 bits)
WORD = 2 bytes (16 bits)

4. What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be?
Leading bytes used to identify file formats (with high probability) are generally called "magic numbers."
In ASCII: `B` then `M` characters

5. What’s the difference between bfSize and biSize?
bfSize is the size, in bytes, of the bitmap file.
biSize is the number of bytes required by the structure.

6. What does it mean if biHeight is negative?
The structure is a top-down DIB and buffering originates from the upper-left corner.

7. What field in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMP’s color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)?
biBitCount

8. Why might fopen return NULL in lines 24 and 32 of copy.c?
When the intptr or outptr is pointing to nothing (aka NULL) because the relevant files do not exist.

9. Why is the third argument to fread always 1 in our code?
There is only ever one element of data to read

10. What value does line 65 of copy.c assign to padding if bi.biWidth is 3?
3

11. What does fseek do?
Changes the file position indicator for the stream pointed to by `stream`.

12. What is SEEK_CUR?
A value used by the whence paramater of fseek to make an offset relative to the current position indicator.
