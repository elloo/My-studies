# 2018 

My main objective for this year is to gain the foundational skillset of a web developer by following P1xt's [JS 2.0 Guide](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides/blob/master/job-ready-javascript-edition-2.0.md). I'll be studying JavaScript, HTML and CSS with some coverage of CS fundamentals and math.
