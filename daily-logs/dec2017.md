# December 2017

Math and Anki studies excluded.

### Day 7
```diff
+ Brushed up on Python and ported the rest of credit.c
    Still need to debug it
```

### Day 8
```diff
+ Freshened up my debugging skills on credit.py
    Improved on my old commentary in the process
+ Began my port of crack.c
    Revisiting this mammoth brings back fond memories!
