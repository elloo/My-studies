### Day 2
```diff
+ Completed my template clone (A fixed, widescreen layout)
    Reviewed HTML semantics, CSS efficiency and creating reusable grids.
- NTS: 
    <img> tags are like <span> tags and leave a gap between other <img> tags. Use negative margin to counteract.
    Chrome has a colour picker in the Developer Tools
    Don't forget to link to resources (e.g. fonts) on all html pages!
```

### Day 5
```diff
+ Began brainstorming and designing for CSS Zen Garden
    Decided to code a layout based off a stock photo.
    Began positioning content - working purely with HTML is interesting!
