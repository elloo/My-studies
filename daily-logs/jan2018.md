# January 2018

Math practice excluded.

### Day 2
```diff
+ Worked on debugging crack.py
    I was able to minimise the code from C quite a bit!
    I need to re-think the logic to allow for Python's higher-level functionality.
```

### Day 4
```diff
+ Completed crack.py
    It's so cool to experience how differences between languages encourage you to think differently about your code!
```

### Day 5
```diff
+ Read through material for Sentimental from pset6... then realised it was updated for 2018. D'oh!    
+ Completed all Sentimental problems from pset6 2018.
+ Fixed and re-submitted a couple of old CS50 files for 2018 transition.
+ Reviewed and studied three weeks of 2018 lecture content.
