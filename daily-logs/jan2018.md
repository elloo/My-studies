# January 2018

Math and Anki studies excluded.

### Day 2
```diff
+ Worked on debugging crack.py
    I was able to minimise the code from C quite a bit!
    I need to re-think the logic to allow for Python's higher-level functionality.
```

### Day 4
```diff
+ Completed crack.py
    It's so cool to experience how differences between languages encourage you to think differently about your code!
